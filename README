Berico's Environmental Intelligence Repository
==============================================

This is a project to exploit environmental data and apply it to intelligence gathering and operational efforts.

Currently, the project includes a simple model for Observations and a parser that handles METAR encoded strings.  The project will be expanded to handle TAFS, Upper Air (RAOB), Synoptic Observations, etc.
